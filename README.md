## Explanation :

The real-time Tic-Tac-Toe project combines computer vision and artificial intelligence to create an interactive game. Using OpenCV, the project captures and processes live video input to detect and interpret the Tic-Tac-Toe grid drawn on paper or any surface. Players can make moves by placing markers (like X or O) in the grid, which the system recognizes through image processing techniques. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, trained to classify these markers, determines the state of the game after each move. The AI opponent, implemented using the Minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning, calculates the optimal moves to play against the human player. This project showcases the integration of computer vision and AI algorithms to create an engaging real-time gaming experience.
